      <td>Frank has an Ivy League education on business, and he counts with 15+ years of experience in business. He was leading a business development team at Accenture, working on projects for Nike until, during the uncertain time of the Covid pandemic, he decided to make use of his gathered professional experience to start a venture of his own. He bootstraped his initial efforts investing money from his own pocket into his business project. He came up with a name for his company himself, he registered the web domain of the company himself, he posted a job on Upwork to get a quick logo done by a cheap designer, and he created his business' website himself on Wix. He reached out to a few close, like-minded, experienced colleagues with whom he has worked previously on other business and offered them to be a part of the team he's leading. After a couple of months of launching his business, he closed a long-term contract for continuous consulting services for a large corporation. This allowed him to expand his team by hiring an executive assistant and formalize other aspects of his business like bookkeeping so he doesn't have to take care of everything completely by himself. Now that the business has some dough and a couple of regular clients he wants to scale his operation to take in new, bigger clients to really make a difference in the income the consulting firm generates. However, as a savvy business person, he realizes that the quick logo that he got done for cheap and the Wix website he created himself do not express the level of professionalism he's hoping to communicate to potential clients.</td>

      <td>Catherine has a background in marketing with a strong focus on closing new clients and upselling existing ones through social media, PR, and email marketing campaigns. In previous jobs, she helped startups get out the door and make the most use of their funding to establish themselves in the market and fulfill their expected ROI. Three years ago, the head of HR of a young fintech startup reached out to her, offering the role of CMO. Since then, she successfully put new marketing strategies into action that showed significantly positive ROI results with an exponential increase in registrations of new users. However, most of the in-house staff at the company are heavily oriented in developing new features for the product, and she realizes that the visual identity of the brand has suffered from neglect at the hand of a creative team that is strong in UX, but not in branding and visual design. The logo of the app is OK, but it's not great. The UI has inconsistencies in the use of color and typography, and the set of illustrations they use looks too generic. With the number of sign-ups and retention recently stalling, she proposed to the C-level to refresh their brand with a more eye-pleasing visual identity to make the app more attractive over its competitors and show a more promising value for its price. However, her team is not particularly strong in branding; plus, they could use a fresh set of eyes.</td>
