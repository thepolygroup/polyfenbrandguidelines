  <h3 class="heading-2">2.4. Creative Concept</h3>
  <h4>The midpoint between business and creativity</h4>
  <p>This concise sentence is the unifying concept that guides the branding process. Unlike a slogan, this phrase is not necessarily meant for use in public communications, but it serves as a mantra when creating the logo, choosing a typeface, designing business cards, copywriting the websiteâ€™s content, or developing any other touchpoint between the brand and the audience. The creative concept ensures that all elements of the brand will consistently convey a reliable and professional message.</p>
  <p>The core concept of our identity is that we interpret our client's business and translate it into a creative expression that speaks to the client's audience.</p>
  <p>This creative concept should be reflected in our brand and our visual identity.</p>
